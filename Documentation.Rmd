# Introduction

The most recent parliamentary elections in Switzerland took place on October 22, 2023. Switzerland's bicameral parliament comprises the National Council, which proportionally represents the Swiss population with seats allocated to each canton based on its population, and the Council of States, where all cantons have equal representation. As the National Council reflects the population proportionally, its election results are often regarded as an indicator of trends in public opinion regarding politics and policy.

Over the past several decades, the distribution of dominant political parties in Swiss national elections has remained relatively stable. The primary parties represented in the federal parliament, along with their respective campaign focuses in the most recent elections, are detailed below. For improved readability, this paper will rely on german-language party names.

| Party | 2023 Campaign Focus |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| SVP | Right-wing, anti-immigration, anti-welfare, free market policies |
| SP | Left-wing, pro-welfare, pro-worker policies, cost of living |
| FDP | Center-right, free market policies and improved access to international markets |
| Die Mitte | Conservative centrist, defense spending, lower tax of married couples |
| GLP | Progressive centrist, climate protection, EU alignment, liberal market policies |
| GPS | Left-wing, climate protection, biodiversity, state regulation of business |

While many European countries have seen an extraordinary rise of right-wing politics throughout the 2010s, not much had shifted in Switzerland. The right-wing SVP (Schweizerische Volkspartei, in french: Union d√©mocratique du centre UDC) has been part of the governing coalition since the 1990s. Certain segments of the party have been classified as far-right and right-wing extremist, most notably due to the party's hardline positions on migration and strict opposition to any legal protection of social, cultural and religious minorities like swiss muslims or LGBT citizens.
